    pageIntro: >
        Years of working closely with our clients brought to the surface some issues that slowed down the design process. That is why we came up with our ‘Creatubh Process’ which makes it simple for us to understand your expectations and easy for you to achieve the best results in a shorter time!

    stepOne:
        title: The Creatubh Form
        copy: >
            Once you get in touch with us, we will send you the Creatubh form that will help us have a better understanding of your needs and requirements before the call.
    stepTwo:
        title: Jump on a call
        copy: >
            Pop on a call with us! We believe that the best way to create together is communication. We want to have a complete idea of what you want to achieve digitally before starting the design process. 
    stepThree:
        title: Initial Designs
        copy: >
            After the initial call, we will proceed with the creation of two examples of logos, website homepages, marketing designs or social media content based on what we discussed. We will contact you to review and tell us your preference!
    stepFour:
        title: Production
        copy: >
            Once the design has been approved, we will start to finalise the design project. We will begin to roll out the artwork across all the agreed elements. Final text amends will be allowed at this stage. 
    stepFive:
        title: Final Look
        copy: >
            After finalising the design, we will show you the final project so that you can review it and let us know if changes, such as text and images, are needed.
    stepSix:
        title: Launch
        copy: >
            This is the stage that should make you thrilled! Once you are fully satisfied with the final design, we will launch your website or provide all the final artwork.
